# JARIS System

## Overview
The **JARIS (Justified Acronym Representation & Inference System)** is an AI-driven symbolic transformation system designed for acronym encoding, symbolic decoding, and optimization using various algorithms, including Viterbi-style decoding. JARIS integrates context-aware transformations, machine learning models for dynamic refinement, and a robust graph-based structure for symbolic reasoning. 

The system is designed to handle complex sequences, transforming input words into symbolic representations, processing them efficiently, and optimizing transformation sequences for different goals (e.g., speed, cost).

## Features

- **Symbolic Transformation**: The core functionality of JARIS is its ability to transform words based on a triadic mapping system and apply dynamic transformations using context and state information.
  
- **Viterbi-style Decoders**: The system includes multiple decoders optimized for different goals:
  - Speed optimization (minimizing computation time)
  - Cost optimization (minimizing transition costs)
  - Customizable scoring functions based on transition probabilities, weights, or other factors.
  
- **Context-Aware Transformations**: JARIS accounts for the broader context of each word in a sequence, enabling more accurate transformations by considering neighboring words or past decisions.

- **Integration with Machine Learning**: The system uses machine learning models to refine the scoring function dynamically based on real data, allowing continuous optimization of transformation paths.

## Installation
